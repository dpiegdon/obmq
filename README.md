One Bit Message Queue
=====================

Byte-message-queue that will clock each message over a bit-wide
channel, using a self-clocking, human-readable code.

This is useful e.g. if a microcontroller has only a single LED and
no other easy accessible debug lines. The messages will be clocked
out on this LED in a human-readable way - albeit this takes a little
bit of practise.
